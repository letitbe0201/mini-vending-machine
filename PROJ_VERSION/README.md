## Abstract
This is a vending machine that accepts dime, quater and dollar. Assuming there are 5 items with different prices(i.g. item: 50 cents, item B: 80 cents, etc.) The user chooses what they want as well as the desired amount of item. The vending machine will display how much money, in cents, the user has inserted on the 7-segment display LED. It also displays the amount of money to be returned if the inserted money exceeds the price.
